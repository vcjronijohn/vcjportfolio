Page looks similar to a stack of stationary. 
Colors are muted shades of plum, soft white and gray.
Simple Arial style font.
Sections are either dark with light print or light with dark print.
There should be blank space around the edgres of the "stationary" as though it was a note card or letter. Subtle if any border around it.
Buttons have a feel like a post-it note affixed to the stack further adding to the stationary feel of the style.
