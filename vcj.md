Where am I from:

I was born in Maryland and have lived in Japan and Germany. While I am an American, some of my childhood was spent outside its borders, so I would say I'm from the world. 

What am I working on:

I have been participating in a web development coding bootcamp since June trying to rebrand myself and change the course of my career. 

What am I interested in:

I am interested in doing many things. Professionally I love the field of Information Technology because it is not only challanging, but continually changing. I have much experience in systems administration as well as workstation support. I am particularly interested in solving problems and testing new technologies. I was once a Storage Area Network manager where I not only was responsible for most of the enterprise's data, but making sure that our users had access to their network attached storage with minimum outages and recovering that data in the event of data loss. 

Personally I am interested in traveling, which these days means packing up the RV to go camping, teaching yoga, reading, watching movies, going to concerts, crafting, and meeting new people.

I'd like to find a workplace where I can be a part of a team not just as a worker, but a person.
